                      IT departments are complex environments, and before you can provide a solution for workflows, you should be aware of the real requirements. Of course, we offer expert knowledge about Puppet, but we also have many years of experience in IT, system administration and network and cluster configuration. We know exactly what IT departments have to face in everyday life, but as consultants, we also know the typical weak spots. We have seen too often how not to do it.
