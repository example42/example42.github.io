In this episode of Abnormal DevOps Iterations, we chat with Dylan Ratcliffe, founder and CEO of Overmind, a tool designed to predict the "blast radius" and risks of infrastructure changes.

Dylan shares the story behind Overmind, inspired by a critical error he made, and how it now leverages GPT-4 to analyze dependencies and detect potential issues before deployment.

We dive into the complexities of modern DevOps, the evolving roles of tools like Puppet, trends in IT infrastructure, and the impact of open-source standards on simplifying complex systems.

A must-watch for anyone interested in DevOps, AI in infrastructure, and the future of IT
