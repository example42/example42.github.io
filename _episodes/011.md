In this episode of Abnormal DevOps Iterations, we sit down with Bernd Erk, CEO of NETWAYS and co-creator of Icinga. We discuss the evolution of IT monitoring from Nagios to Icinga, the challenges of adapting to cloud-native and Kubernetes environments, and the balance between traditional monitoring and dynamic observability.
Bernd shares insights on open-source business models, the impact of AI on tech and society, and his thoughts on the future of IT infrastructure automation.

From technical discussions about monitoring tools to a broader conversation about AI, open source, and the human element in tech, this episode is packed with fascinating insights and ideas.
