In our tech deep dives we ask authors or experts of Open Source software to describe, explain and demonstrate their creature.
We expect a technical audience, without necessarily some prior knowledge of the tool under scrutiny.

The first tech deep dive is with our friend Riaan Nolan and his little gem: Hashiqube, a Docker / VirtualBox based Vagrant environment where you can easily test, use and practice with tools from Hashicorp and other vendors.

The clever usage of DevContainers allows you to even install and test these products via a browser on GitHub, without even the need to have a machine where to run them.
