summary: "The evolution of platform engineering, its impact on infrastructure, and the future of open source technology."
quotes:
  - "We overestimate tech’s short-term impact and underestimate the long-term."
  - "Infrastructure is too complicated, and simplifying it is essential."
  - "You can't just give people a black box; they need to poke at it when things go wrong."
  - "Open source is not free; it's important to be conscious of its implications."

In this episode, we sit down with Nigel Kersten, Chief Product Officer at Platform.sh and a prominent figure in the DevOps world, to discuss the future of technology, the evolution of DevOps, and the growing influence of AI on the industry.

Nigel reflects on his journey from working with Puppet to simplifying infrastructure through modern platform services.

He shares insights on how his current role at Platform.sh focuses on enabling developers to deploy applications with ease, using GitOps-driven methodologies to streamline workflows.

We also dive deep into the complexities behind the abstraction layers that make modern cloud platforms function and how developers can manage complex applications more effectively.

Nigel offers a candid perspective on the state of DevOps, including his thoughts on how the term has lost meaning and how platform engineering is rising as the next big trend.

The conversation also touches on critical topics such as the environmental impact of AI and cloud computing, the future of compute workloads at the edge, and the ethical challenges the industry faces in managing energy consumption while advancing cutting-edge technologies.

We wrap up by exploring the future of open-source software and how monetization models are evolving in 2024.

Key Topics:
Moving from Puppet to Platform.sh
The rise of platform engineering and the shift from DevOps
GitOps-driven development and simplifying complex infrastructures
The environmental cost of AI and cloud services
Future computing trends: edge workloads and efficiency
The current state of open-source and monetization challenges in 2024
