In this special episode of Abnormal DevOps Iterations, we dive deep into the evolving world of Puppet discussing the recent events and the consequential fork.

Our panel includes:

Tim Meusel (Vox Pupuli PMC) – Longtime contributor and leader in the Puppet open-source ecosystem.
David Sandilands (Perforce/Puppet) – Community and Developer Relations Lead at Puppet.
Ben Ford (Vox Pupuli Contributor) – Former Puppet employee and open-source advocate, now helping drive the new OpenVox fork.

They discuss Puppet’s recent shift after the Perforce acquisition, what the new Puppet Core and Enterprise offerings mean for users, and why the community decided to create the OpenVox fork.

If you’ve ever used or contributed to Puppet, this conversation is essential listening.

Discover how the community is reorganizing under Vox Pupuli, how Perforce plans to shape Puppet’s future, and how you can get involved or contribute.
