In this episode of "Abnormal DevOps Iterations," we are joined by Nikolay Sivko, founder of Coroot, an open-source observability platform.
Nikolay shares insights into Coroot'sunique approach to automating telemetry data collection and providing actionable insights with zero configuration.
We dive into the role of eBPF technology in enabling full visibility of system performance without impacting applications.
Nikolay also discusses Coroot's business model, the difference between the open-source and enterprise versions, and the future of observability in complex infrastructures.
