summary: Engineering workflows are evolving with a focus on simplifying software delivery through functional package management, addressing complexity in IT, and the intersection of AI and product management.
quotes:
  - "Every time we have a problem, we just add a new layer of abstraction on top of it."
  - "The easiest way to manage something is to not have it at all."
  - "The future may be less deterministic, and that fundamentally breaks my assumptions about computers."
  - "If AI wants to write a novel, I guess it's okay if it's good and people want to read it."

In this episode of Abnormal DevOps Iterations, we sit down with Michael Stahnke, Engineering Lead at Flox, to explore Nix-based developer and IT workflows.
Michael dives into how Flox simplifies complex environments using Nix—a functional package manager—enabling seamless cross-platform compatibility, Terraform version management, and Postgres upgrades.
We also discuss the evolution of DevOps, the rise and future of Puppet, challenges with microservices complexity, and the role of AI in modern IT.
Michael shares insights on system administration trends, the importance of coding in operations, and essential metrics for DevOps success.
