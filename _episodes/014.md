In this episode of “Abnormal DevOps Iterations,” Andrew Clay Shafer—a pioneer in the early DevOps movement—discusses the evolution of agile infrastructures, how organizations can truly embrace continuous learning, and how socio-technical principles still guide effective collaboration. Andrew dives into the explosive impact of AI on productivity, explaining why human insight remains essential for turning AI’s potential into real-world results. From his journey working with tools like Puppet to his take on infrastructure’s next frontiers and the risks of a “post-truth” era, Andrew offers pragmatic perspectives, historical context, and forward-thinking insights on all things DevOps and beyond.
