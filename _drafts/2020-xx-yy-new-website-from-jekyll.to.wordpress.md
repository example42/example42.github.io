title: New website - From Jekyll to Wordpress
---

Six years ago I wrote a post about how example42.com website was migrated [from Drupal to Jekyll](https://blog.example42.com/2014/05/12/from-drupal-to-jekyll/), in all this time the site has happily remained on GitHub pages and hasn't received mayor updates in the general layout.

A few weeks ago we finally changed it, performing another mayor update and migration, but before getting into details, let me review how the example42.com site evolved over the years, courtesy of the Internet Archive [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/example42.com)
