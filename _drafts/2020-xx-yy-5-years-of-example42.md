title: Puppet Tip XYZ - 5 years of example42
---

example42 was founded back in 2015.

I still remeber well, the day where we received information of our official company registration on October 8th 2015 while being at PuppetConf 2015 in Portland, Oregon:

I had a call with my girlfriend in Berlin, Germany and she was excited that I had received a letter from distrcit court, a few hours prior I had to give my [talk about Puppet 4](https://www.slideshare.net/tuxmea/power-of-puppet-4).

I asked her to open the letter: It contained the official company registration letter.

That made us the youngest company at PuppetCOnf 2015, being less than 1 day old!
