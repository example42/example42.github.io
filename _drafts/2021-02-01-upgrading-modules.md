title: Upgrading Puppet Modules
---

Many people use upstream developed Puppet Library modules like stdlib, postgresql, nginx, zypprepo and many more.

Some prefer to stick with the downloaded versions and will update once they update their Puppet infrastructure.
This results in lots of work,



Happy puppetizing,
