title: Puppet Tip XYZ - Happy New Year
---

example42 wishes all customers, partners, colleagues, employees, friends and supporters a healthy, successful and happy new year.

2020 has been difficult for many people and organizations. Many of them suffered due to lockdown and local restrictions.
Just consider musicians, artists and their entourage which had to cancel event after event. Or think about local small business which had to close their shops.

Others were able to continue their business and we are super happy that our customers enabled example42 to continue business.

It was astonishing to see how fast remote work options were created and how people adopted to a new way of working.

In the first few weeks of remote work we still saw people having difficulties with video conferences and the way how to behave and talk when many people attending.
At many occasions we saw that a DevOps mindset, attitude and behavior was super helpful. People started listening, asking questions, pushing themselves to make a meeting happen within time,

This showed us, that DevOps is one of the keys to success in IT.
Without the culture and agile working methods it would have not been possible for most organizations to enable new ways of working within a reasonable amount of time.

We also saw many companies moving - some for the very first time - to Open Source applications. Especially BigBlueButton or Jitsi were carefully proofread from security. Even though it took the project ssome time to adopt the findings.

But having hardware in rack is not enough to enable teams fast. This is where IT Automation comes into place - a core field of example42 business.
Automation heavily reduces the time needed to deploy new systems or bring out changes with almost no effort.

At example42 we are fans of Puppet, Terraform, Vagrant, Vault, GitLab and many other tools which help making IT a smater place to work at.

We appretiate all the support and feedback our csutomers provided to us within one of the most difficult years in modern times.

But support is something that anyone of us can do easily. It does not mean to take a hugh amount of money, but to show respect and think twice prior spending your bucks.

Next time you are thinking about a spending: please think carefully who you want to support? A big company, run by unknown managers or are you going next door to a shop nearby?

Please consider supporting local, small business. These are the ones that suffer most. Big companies receive hugh payments from government. Some of the I would prefer to name "dysfunctional" or even "catatonic".

example42 wishes everybody a healthy, successful and happy new year.
Please stay safe and take care on people who need your help.

Happy puppetizing,

Your team of example42:
