# Sponsors, as usual

As individuals, even before our company was born, we have attended Puppet events since the very beginning: the first PuppetCamp , in San Francisco, on 2009.

In this picture you see me pitching a round table session about Modules Standards, an obsession I had since the very first times.

Since then we almost never missed any global Puppet event and since example42 GmbH was founded, five years ago, we have been sponsors of the yearly major one.

We are happy to sponsor also this year the main Puppet conference: this time is remote only, for the reasons you know, but the feelings and the appreciation for such a great product and company, and the big expectations we have for "that moment in the year" remain the same.

# Presenting at Puppettize Digital

Martin is going to make a presentation at this event.

Look out on the event schedule for it!

# Puppet, for fun and business

We are true lovers of Puppet: we know it, we like it, we actually have fun when working with it, and, yes, we do [business](https://blog.example42.com/2020/11/02/5-years-of-example42/) with it.

We are passionate on sharing and spreading Puppet knowledge, we collaborate with our customers with the focus and aim to make their IT life better while using Puppet to manage their infrastructures.

We do training, consulting, modules development, we helped companies in setting up a Puppet managed infrastructure, migrating their code base, managing with Puppet existing systems.

We always do this with passion and love, trying to be as much flexible as possible in doing it: you don't need to hire us for days or mid/long term engagement, we can provide support also for a single hour, in a quick and effective [Remote Puppet Pair Programming](https://example42.com/services/remote-puppet-pairing/) session.

But we are not here to sell our services, we are here to reiterate our love and support for Puppet: unless you have less than a few dozens of systems to manage or your are completely Cloud Native, you NEED a tool like Puppet, and we definitively believe that in the Configuration Management space, Puppet is the best of the bunch.
