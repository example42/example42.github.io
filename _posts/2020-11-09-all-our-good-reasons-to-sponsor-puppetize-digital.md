# Sponsors, as usual

As individuals, even before our company was born, we have attended Puppet events since the very beginning: the first PuppetCamp , in San Francisco, on 2009. What is impressive looking back at that event is that most of the participants have been hired by Puppet Inc, over the years.

In the picture you see me pitching a round table session about Modules Standards, an obsession I had since the very first times.

Since then we almost never missed any global Puppet event and since example42 GmbH was founded, five years ago, we have always been sponsors of the yearly major one.

We are happy to sponsor the main Puppet conference also in 2020: this time is remote only, for the reasons we all  know, but the feelings and the appreciation for such a great product and company, and the big expectations we have for "that moment in the year" remain the same.

# Presenting at Puppetize Digital

Martin is going to make a presentation at this event, it's titled "Puppet Control Repository and GIT - a comparison of simple vs Git Flow".

He will discuss how to work with Git on a Puppet control-repo and what workflows make sense when dealing with multiple environments.

Check the event schedule and look our for it!

# Puppet, for fun and business

We are true lovers of Puppet: we know it, we like it, we actually have fun when working with it, and, yes, we do [business](https://blog.example42.com/2020/11/02/5-years-of-example42/) with it.

We are passionate on sharing and spreading Puppet knowledge, we collaborate with our customers with the focus and aim to make their IT life better while using Puppet to manage their infrastructures.

We do training, consulting, modules development, we helped companies in setting up a Puppet managed infrastructure, migrating their code base, managing with Puppet existing systems.

We always do this with passion and love, trying to be as much flexible as possible in doing it: you don't need to hire us for days or mid/long term engagement, we can provide support also for a single hour, in a quick and effective [Remote Puppet Pair Programming](https://example42.com/services/remote-puppet-pairing/) session.

But we are not here to sell our services, we are here to reiterate our love and support for Puppet: unless you have less than a few dozens of systems to manage or your are completely Cloud Native, you NEED a tool like Puppet, and we definitively believe that in the Configuration Management space, Puppet is one step ahead.
