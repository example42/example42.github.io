title: Tiny Puppet 1.0

---

So [Tiny Puppet](http://github.com/example42/puppet-tp) 1.0 is out with a dedicated [website](http://tiny-puppet.com) and some collateral repos:

- The [tinydata](https://github.com/example42/tinydata) module, where is defined all the application data used by tp defines.

- The [Tiny Puppet Playground](https://github.com/example42/tp-playground), a Vagrant environment where to play and experiment with tp

- The derived [tp-acceptance](https://github.com/example42/tp-acceptance) Vagrant environment, where tests are done and summarized in this [compatibility matrix](https://github.com/example42/tp-acceptance/blob/master/tests/app_summary.md)

Tiny Puppet ```[install|conf|dir|test|...]``` defines work only with Puppet 4, for older versions use the alternatives with 3 suffix. For example:

- ```tp::install```  # Optimized for Puppet 4 or Puppet 3 with future parser enabled

- ```tp::install3``` # Backwards compatible versions. Work on Puppet 2, 3 and 4.

Enjoy,
