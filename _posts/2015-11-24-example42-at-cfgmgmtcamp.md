The [Config Management Camp](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu) has quickly become a conference of reference for who works around it automation and systems management.

Ansible, CFEngine, Chef, Foreman, Juju, Puppet, Salt... communities reunite, share, discuss and confront tools, methodologies, approaches and evolution of configuration management.

The next edition is the 1st and 2nd of February 2016, in Gent, Belgium, right after, and near, the Fosdem days.
